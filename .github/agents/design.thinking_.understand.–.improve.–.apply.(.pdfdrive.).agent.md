The philosophy behind this venture was the conviction that it is possible to train engineers and scientists to become innovators. Design Thinking has since become a highly recommended course in the Stanford engineering curriculum. The method of Design Thinking melds an end-user focus with multidisciplinary collaboration and iterative improvement and is a powerful tool for achieving desirable, user-friendly, and economically viable design solutions and innovative products and services. In 2007, a second School of Design Thinking, operating under similar premises, was established at the HassoPlattner-Institute (HPI) for IT Systems Engineering in Potsdam, Germany. It has been equally successful in attracting students and external partners from industry, the public sector, and society, and producing innovative products and services solutions. My motivation behind initiating the HPI-Stanford Design Thinking Research Program was the desire to understand why and how the Design Thinking method works on a scientific basis. Through joint research projects, we try to figure out which factors ultimately contribute to the success of this type of innovation in all areas of life. In order to implement innovation processes in industry and the public sector, we must strive to improve our understanding of them. My main interest is to see the Design Thinking method used in IT/engineering and to understand how it inspires creative multidisciplinary teamwork across faculties; whether and how spatial, time, and cultural boundaries can be overcome; and how it can be meshed with traditional approaches in the field of engineering. We might also be able to propose different organizational structures for design teams in corporations. It has also been a mystery to me for a long time why the structure of successful design teams differs so substantially from traditional corporate structures. I am delighted and proud to see this transatlantic research cooperation thrive and develop into a potent academic force in the field of innovation research, and I am confident that answers to some of these questions can be found  and to an v vi Foreword extent  have already been found. This volume presents the first comprehensive collection of the research studies carried out by the HPI-Stanford Design Thinking Research Program and is an excellent starting point for the new Springer series on Understanding Innovation.
