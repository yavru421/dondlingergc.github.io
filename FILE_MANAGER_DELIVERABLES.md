## 📞 Contact & Questions

### 9 Questions for Stakeholder Clarification
(From FILE_MANAGER_SUMMARY.md)

These questions should be discussed before implementation begins:

1. Should deleted files have permanent deletion option, or only 7-day expiry?
2. Do you want ZIP download support in MVP or Phase 2?
3. Should we implement rename in MVP or defer to Phase 2?
4. Any integrations with other desktop apps (blueprint viewer, website builder)?
5. Should file manager auto-open when files are uploaded?
6. Desktop notification on new file arrival?
7. Share/public link support timeline?
8. Maximum file size limit for uploads?
9. Should we cache full file data or metadata-only?
